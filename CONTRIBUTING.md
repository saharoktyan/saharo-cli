## Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to Saharo CLI.

### Principles

- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever abstractions.
- Avoid adding new dependencies unless clearly justified.

### Development

The CLI is a Python 3.11+ project.

Common commands (from `saharo-cli/cli/`):

```bash
python -m compileall -q .
pytest -q
```
