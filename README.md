# Saharo CLI

Saharo is a lightweight control-plane for single servers (VPS) and small fleets:
desired state -> apply -> monitoring -> updates, without Kubernetes.

This repo contains the CLI and its Python SDK (used by the CLI).

## Status

The project is in active development and currently transitioning from a VPN-focused workflow
to a generic "manage any services via desired-state YAML" workflow.

## License

Apache-2.0. See `LICENSE` and `NOTICE`.
